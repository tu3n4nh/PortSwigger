## Prevent access control vulnerabilities

Access control vulnerabilities can generally be prevented by taking a defense-in-depth approach and applying the following principles:

- Never rely on obfuscation alone for access control.
- Unless a resource is intended to be publicly accessible, deny access by default.
- Wherever possible, use a single application-wide mechanism for enforcing access controls.
- At the code level, make it mandatory for developers to declare the access that is allowed for each resource, and deny access by default.
- Thoroughly audit and test access controls to ensure they are working as designed.
