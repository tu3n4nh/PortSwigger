This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user. 

Consider an application that lets users login in with a user name and password. If a user submits the username wiener and the password bluecheese, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'
If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejectedd.
Here, to login to the application as the administrator user we submit the username admminstrator and about the password we need inject a query, which return TRUE value (make the server believe that you sent the correct password and allow you to login as administrator)

    Because the method used is POST so we can't inject data in url, we need to use BurpSuite to intercept the POST request and modify the data was submited.
