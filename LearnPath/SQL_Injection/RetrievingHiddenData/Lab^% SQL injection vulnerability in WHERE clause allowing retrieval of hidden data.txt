This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased. 

To show all products in any category we cause the query return TRUE (ex: or 1=1,...) and in order to show both released and unreleased we use the double-dash sequence -- is a comment indicator in SQL at the end of payload (means  that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment. This effectively removes th remainder of query, so it no longer includes AND released = 1)
